# CONCLUSION
- While Paseo achieved market-leading sales at 28%, it also accounted for the highest expenses—signaling an operational strain. Carretera had the lowest sales at 12% and incurred the lowest expenses amongst the rest of products.  
- 2014 marked an increase of over $9M in profit, reaching $13.01M—a sharp acceleration from the prior year’s $3.88M  
- VTT: from $8K to $24K (+200%)  
- Profits across countries are fairly similar ($3M–$4M), despite differences in sales volume. And All countries show a relatively low profit-to-sales ratio, suggesting high costs of production.  
- Manufacturing costs increased across all products, although for both Montana and Carretera the increase was significantly low.  
- VTT and Amarilla had the largest increase in manufacturing cost:  
  - Amarilla: from $6K to $20K (+230%)  
- Paseo is the most efficient and profitable product, leading in countries such as Canada and the United States.  

### Cont.…
- October is the best-selling month in majority of the countries with leading sales in Germany and France.  
- Significantly low sales In both Q1 and Q2 in majority of the countries.  
- The sales pattern in the USA are fairly stable with an increase towards Q4.  

# RECOMMENDATION
- **Double Down on Paseo**  
  - Leverage Paseo’s strong sales at (28%) and profit performance.  
  - Focus on marketing and distribution in Canada, Germany, and the USA where it’s already doing well compared to the other products.  

- **Reduce Manufacturing Cost Overruns**  
  - Audit high-cost products: VTT (+200%) and Amarilla (+230%).  
  - Also Optimize on production and renegotiate supplier contracts for best price.  

- Reevaluate the pricing models for each product as well as the operational spend to boost Profit Margins.  
- Implement a lean manufacturing process to help lower the cost of production while ensuring customer satisfaction.  
- Tap Into Seasonal Sales Peaks by aligning on marketing campaigns for the top performing months; October and December.  
- Introduce customer loyalty programs and promotions especially during low seasons to encourage the customers to buy more hence translating into much sales.  

- **Reevaluate Carretera’s Future**  
  - With the lowest sales at 12%, reassess its market fit or consider relocating its resources to high performing products.  
  - Alternatively, you may use Paseo (the best selling) as a process benchmark to examine if the production process of a certain product has loopholes and how to correct it.
